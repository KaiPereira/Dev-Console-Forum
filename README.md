# About

This was a funny little app I made when bored in class. It's a funny little anonymous forum hidden on a blank page accessible inside of the dev console. As soon as you load into the forum, all previous messages will load
# Weird

The server is kind of funky because I had to make everything in codespaces

# How to Use

To use, you have to replace the server with a local server on 3000 and then if you go inside of the dev console, you can use

```
send("Hello World!")
```

to send a message in the console
